## Usage

The `nodepay-bot` can be run using Docker or manually.

### Get your user ID

you can obtain your user ID from the nodepay website:

- Visit [https://app.nodepay.ai](https://app.nodepay.ai/register?ref=ffWdlWvILxU2eSW)
- Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
- Go to the "Console" tab.
- Paste the following command and press Enter:

```javascript
copy(localStorage.getItem('np_token'));
```

- Copy the value returned, which is your user ID.

### Prepare proxies

You can buy proxies from [ProxyCheap](https://app.proxy-cheap.com/r/ksvW8Z) or any other proxy provider.

> It seems that the official has restricted that a maximum of 10 nodes are valid for one account. So please don't configure too many proxies for each account. It is recommended to have a maximum of 10.

### Running the Bot with Docker (not ready)

1. Create a text file named `tokens.txt` with your copied `np_token`.
1. Create a text file named `proxies.txt` with the desired proxy URLs. Ensure each URL is in the format:

```plaintext
http://username:password@hostname1:port
http://username:password@hostname2:port
// or
socks5://username:password@hostname1:port
socks5://username:password@hostname2:port
```

> Note: You can use HTTP or SOCKS5 proxies, and you can config with multiple proxies in the `proxies.txt` file (one proxy per line).

1. Run the `nodepay-bot` using Docker:

#### Single Accounts

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v $(pwd)/tokens.txt:/app/tokens.txt \
  -v $(pwd)/proxies.txt:/app/proxies.txt \
  overtrue/nodepay-bot
```

#### Multi Accounts

If you have multiple accounts, you can create a `tokens.txt` file with the following format:

```plaintext
eyJh...
eyJi...
```

and create a dir named `proxies/N.txt` with the following structure, `N` is the account index, starting from 1,

for example, if you have 3 accounts, you should create 3 proxies files:

```plaintext
proxies/1.txt
proxies/2.txt
proxies/3.txt
```

> Note: You can use HTTP or SOCKS5 proxies, and you can config with multiple proxies in the `proxies/N.txt` file (one proxy per line).
>
> It seems that the official has restricted that a maximum of 10 nodes are valid for one account. So please don't configure too many proxies for each account. It is recommended to have a maximum of 10.

and run the bot with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v $(pwd)/tokens.txt:/app/tokens.txt \
  -v $(pwd)/proxies:/app/proxies \
  overtrue/nodepay-bot
```
